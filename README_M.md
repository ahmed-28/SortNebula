 Merge Sort:
 void merge_arr()

   This function merges two sub already sorted subarrays in a sorted format. It will access both arrays and find the 
   minimal values and populate the array.


 void m_sort()
   The left index and right index of the array to be sorted is given as parameters and then the function divides the 
   given array into two halves(need not be equal) and calls itself twice with the respective array parameters.
   
 int main ()

  Accept the mapping. Then find the no of digits of the largest second coordinate. then val = 10**(the number of digits).
  new array will have data as x*val + y and will be sorted by calling the sorting function. The respective index(in second row)
 is also swapped. finally the order of index in sorted array is used to produce the ascending sort of actual array.
