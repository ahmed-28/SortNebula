Quick Sort:

  int part()

   This is a partition function. Pivot is set as the highest element on the array and then elements are compared with
   the pivot and then swapped and returns index of smaller element.

  void q_sort()

     Implements quicksort by first calling part with the parameters and then with the return value calls itself recursively.

 int main ()

  Accept the mapping. Then find the no of digits of the largest second coordinate. then val = 10**(the number of digits).
  new array will have data as x*val + y and will be sorted by calling the sorting function. The respective index(in second row)
 is also swapped. finally the order of index in sorted array is used to produce the ascending sort of actual array.
